Any future updates or modifications to these resources will be documented here. Interested users can visit this repository as a single starting point for easy access to the necessary pointers for their work.

## PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES

Package Requirements:
```
pandas, numpy, pytorch, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
```


## 1. PROCESSED DATA:

### 1.1 CONFIGURATION DATASET FILES

Create a directory called ```<parent_directory>/input_data/data_L_1/configs_csv/``` for storing the configuration/dataset files, which can be downloaded from the following link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11yvnHoBA5n8AIvSM_Lg8b3gTPMuBQAMQ?usp=sharing

The above directory contains 50 files, which occupy a combined disk space of ```1.35 GB```. Each file represents a configuration dataset, representing data belonging to a particular configuration of the furnace. As each of the configuration datasets are distinct, there is no overlap among a pair of files. Some of them are used collectively for training a model, and then the model is evaluated on a set of datasets for testing the model performance.

```<parent_directory>``` is the root project directory ```HZPCNet```, and is stored as the variable ```repo_path_prefix``` in the training scripts.

### 1.2 CONSOLIDATED CONFIGURATION DATASET SPLITS

To save time, a ```.npz file``` containing pre-processed data can be stored in the following location:
```<parent_directory>/input_data/data_L_1/pre_saved_npfiles/zonenet_npfile.npz```

This file can be downloaded from the following link:

## 2. TOTAL EXCHANGE AREA FILES

The TEA files are present in:
```<parent_directory>/input_data/<TEA>.txt```

where, ```<TEA>: {GG, SS, SG, GS}```

## 3. MODEL TRAINING SCRIPT DEMO

Path to directory containing model training scripts for a model ```<model_name>```:
```<parent_directory>/scripts_train/data_L/v2_scripts/<model_name>```

where we can have ```<model_name> : {PBDLSTM, PBKAN, â€¦ }``` for different methods. Here, we present a sample jupyter notebook for ```PBDLSTM```.

The network architectures for other methods are inspired from the following links:

3.1 KAN: https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan 

3.2 xLSTM: https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm
